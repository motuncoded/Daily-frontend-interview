#10
  This problem was asked by Intel.

You are given an array and a target value, move all instances of that target value to the end end of the array

Example
function moveElement(arr, val){
 
};

// testcase
const arr = [2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2];
console.log(moveElement(arr, 2)); // [4, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
Explanation: All the occurences of 2 are moved at the end of the array.
